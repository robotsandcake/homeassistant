# Nmap Device Tracker #

## As an alternative to the router-based device tracking, it is possible to directly scan the network for devices by using Nmap. The IP addresses to scan can be specified in any format that Nmap understands, including the network-prefix notation (192.168.1.1/24) and the range notation (192.168.1.1-255). https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/nmap_tracker/ ##
