# Bluetooth Tracker #

# This tracker discovers new devices on boot and tracks Bluetooth devices periodically based on interval_seconds value. It is not required to pair the devices with each other! Devices discovered are stored with ‘bt_’ as the prefix for device MAC addresses in known_devices.yaml. https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/bluetooth_tracker/ ##
