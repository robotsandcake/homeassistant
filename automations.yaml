    begin to simulate sunset in the bedroom every night at the same time.  It does
    this by slowly turning the bedroom light to a pure Red colour, thereby removing
    blue light from the environment.  It is blue light which can help the body produce
    cortisol.  Cortisol is a stress hormone can suppress atoning melatonin, with melatonin
    being the hormone helps asleep.  And stuff.
