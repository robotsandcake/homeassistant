# Home Assistant Config by [@RobotsandCake](https://github.com/robotsandcake) #

(This README and repository are a work in progress.)

These [YAML](http://yaml.org) configuration files for the home automation software [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) are designed for people with motor-skill difficulties like mine. For example I flash the lights throughout the house to summon help if I need it. Some of you able-bodied people might find some use in the things here, and you are also welcome.

## Hardware ##

I use an old [Mac Mini (2011)](https://support.apple.com/kb/sp632?locale=en_US). It doesn't really have the grunt to run the most recent macOS properly, but it's absolutely perfect for running Home Assistant. It's been up for over a year without crashing and the hardware is just lovely.

## Software ##


### Operating System

[Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) Server](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/) is the base for the entire system. It is the Long-Term Support (LTS) version which means it will get updates into the future, and it's very well supported with a large community surrounding [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) which makes diagnosing and solving problems easier.

### Home Assistant (The Lynchpin)

[Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) is the most important piece of software in my Home automation set up. It's the central hub that glues together all of the disparate Internet of Things (IoT) devices that wouldn't ordinarily be compatible with each other. There are components for everything. 

## Devices ##

I group my devices by function. If it is super confusing please let me know so I can do nothing about it except cry.  Thanks.
