# IBM Watson TTS #

## The watson_tts text-to-speech platform that works with [IBM Watson Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/text-to-speech/) to create the spoken output. Watson is a paid service via IBM Cloud but there is a decent free tier which offers 10000 free characters every month. https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/watson_tts/ ##
