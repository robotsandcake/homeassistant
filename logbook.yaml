# Logbook #

## The logbook integration provides a different perspective on the history of your house by showing all the changes that happened to your house in reverse chronological order. It depends on the recorder integration for storing the data. This means that if the recorder integration is set up to use e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL as data store, the logbook integration does not use the default SQLite database to store data. https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/logbook/
